  <p1> Icivics is a website that focuses on having the player recognize and remember the bill of rights in a fun and interesting concept. You own a own firm of lawyers who specialize in constitutional law. 
    Decide if potential clients have a right, match them with the best lawyer, and win the case. The more clients you serve and the more cases you win, the faster your law firm grows.
    When you gave the right clients to the best lawyer, you would get a currency called reputation. Reputation can be used to buy more lawyers, make your firm looking more the part, or add personal buffs
    such as purchasing a coffe machine to make the character go faster, or being able to create a twitter account and when you scroll threw twitter you gain a small amount of repuation.</p1>
